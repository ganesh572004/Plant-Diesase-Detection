🌿 Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

📌 Overview
This project aims to detect plant diseases from leaf images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It helps farmers and agriculturists identify crop diseases early, allowing for timely intervention and reduced crop loss.

🚀 Features
Image-based disease detection for various plant species.
Real-time prediction via webcam or uploaded image.
User-friendly interface (CLI or Web-based).
Trained on standard datasets like PlantVillage.
High accuracy and low inference time.
🧠 Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras – Model training and prediction
OpenCV – Image preprocessing
NumPy / Pandas – Data handling
Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualization
Flask / Streamlit (optional) – Web interface
Jupyter Notebook – Prototyping and model training
🗂️ Dataset
Source: PlantVillage Dataset
Contains over 50,000 labeled images across different plant species and disease categories.
